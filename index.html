        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Alex Mori. I'm 17 years old and I'm from Lima, Perú. I enjoy doing different
            things in my free time, like drawing, cooking, and learning new skills. I'm currently studying software
            development because I'm really interested in technology and programming. I also like spending time with
            my friends and family. I'm excited to know what the future has in store for me. Nice to meet you all!

        <p>Perú is a country on the western coast of South America. It is bordered by Ecuador and Colombia to the north,
            Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The
            country is known for its diverse geography, having different landscapes from the Andes Mountains to the
            Amazon rainforest and deserts. Peru is also famous for its cuisine, music, and traditions,
            and a major tourist destination for its ancient sites. Machu Picchu, the iconic Inca monument located in
            the city of Cuzco,
            is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
