            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Alex Mori. I'm 17 years old and I'm from Lima, Perú. In my free time, I enjoy
                doing different
                things like drawing, cooking, and learning new skills that help me grow both personally and
                academically.
                I'm currently
                studying software development because I'm really interested in technology, programming, and the way
                digital
                tools can
                make life easier and more creative.

                Besides that, I like spending time with my friends and family, whether it's sharing a meal, going out
                together, or just
                having fun conversations. I consider myself curious and motivated, always looking for opportunities to
                improve and
                discover new passions. I'm really excited to see what the future has in store for me, and I look forward
                to
                learning
                from new experiences and meeting new people. Nice to meet you all!
            </p>

            <p>Perú is a country on the western coast of South America. It is bordered by Ecuador and Colombia to the
                north,
                Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The
                country is known for its diverse geography, having different landscapes from the Andes Mountains to the
                Amazon rainforest and deserts. Peru is also famous for its cuisine, music, and traditions,
                and a major tourist destination for its ancient sites. Machu Picchu, the iconic Inca monument located in
                the city of Cuzco,
                is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
